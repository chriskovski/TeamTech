System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1): i got this error as i wanted to start
postgrsql with: systemctl start postgrsql
As an alternative to Systemd in WSL i ve choosed: Docker because It Doesn't interfere with other packages already installed (no dependency issues)
The Docker images themselves pretty much never use Systemd, so you can often inspect the Dockerfile to see how the service is started without Systemd
